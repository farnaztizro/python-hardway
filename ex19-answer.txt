give the function numbers directly:
you have 20 cheeses!
you have 10 boxes of crackers!
that's enough for a party.

or we can use variables from our script:
you have 30 cheeses!
you have 50 boxes of crackers!
that's enough for a party.

we can even do math inside:
you have 40 cheeses!
you have 3 boxes of crackers!
that's enough for a party.

and we can combile var and math:
you have 40 cheeses!
you have 70 boxes of crackers!
that's enough for a party.
